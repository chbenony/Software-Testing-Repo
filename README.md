# Software-Testing-Repo
This is the main repository we'll be using for Software Testing.<br>
I just added the files for Controller, Model and Utilities.

Feel free to add your code for the Unit testing, Subsystem testing & System testing.

If you guys aren't used to using GitHub on the command line, here are some tips:

To add a file to the repo:<br>
1. git add name_of_file_or_directory</br>
2. git commit -m "Whatever message you want" </br>
3. git push origin master </br>

You guys can add different branches and stuff if you want. Just </br>
be careful of merge conflicts!</br>
